## Desktop version (foodguide-app)

The [foodguide-app](https://github.com/bluehexagons/foodguide-app) repository has source code and release
builds for a thin Electron wrapper around this project.


## Development

Pull requests and bug reports are greatly appreciated if anything is out of sync with Don't Starve's current versions.

The Unofficial Don't Starve Food Guide requires no setup and uses no imported code, and is a simple collection of JavaScript/HTML/CSS files. It must be served on a web server so that the JavaScript modules can be loaded by a web browser.

To format code automatically using eslint rules, run `npx eslint --fix` or your preferred formatting method.
This is not required before submitting a PR, as it will be run regardless.
